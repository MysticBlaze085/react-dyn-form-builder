To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests/storbyook testing).
- All public API methods must be documented. (Details TBD).
- We follow [Google's JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html), but wrap all code at 100 characters.
